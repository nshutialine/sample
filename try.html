    <h1> Introducttion to HTML </h1>
    <p> At its heart, HTML is a fairly <strong>simple language</strong>  made up of elements, which can be applied to pieces of text to give them different meaning in a document (Is it a paragraph? Is it a bulleted list? Is it part of a table?), structure a document into logical sections (Does it have a header? Three columns of content? A navigation menu?), and embed content such as images and videos into a page.,<br>
        This module will <em>introduce</em> introduce the first two of these and introduce fundamental concepts and syntax you need to know to understand HTML. <br><br><br>
