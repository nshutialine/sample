    <h1> Introduction to HTML </h1>
    <p> HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the code that is used to structure a web page and its content. 
        For example, content could be structured within a set of paragraphs, a list of bulleted points, or using images and data tables.
         As the title suggests, this article will give you a basic understanding of HTML and its functions.. 
    </p>
    
    <h2> So what is HTML</h2>
    <P>HTML is a <em>markup language</em> that defines the structure of your content. 
       HTML consists of a series of <strong>elements</strong>, which you use to enclose, or wrap, different parts of the content to make it appear a certain way, or act a certain way.
       The enclosing tags can make a word or image hyperlink to somewhere else, can italicize words, can make the font bigger or smaller, and so on.

    <h2>Anatomy of an HTML element</h2>

    <p> The main parts of our element are as follows:</p> 
    <ol>
        <li><strong>The opening tag:</strong> This consists of the name of the element (in this case, p), wrapped in opening and closing <strong>angle brackets</strong>. 
            This states where the element begins or starts to take effect — in this case where the paragraph begin</li>
        <li> <strong>The closing tag:</strong> This is the same as the opening tag, except that it includes a forward slash before the element name. This states where the element ends — in this case where the paragraph ends.
             Failing to add a closing tag is one of the standard beginner errors and can lead to strange results.</li>
        <li><strong>The content:</strong> This is the content of the element, which in this case, is just text</li>
        <li><strong>The element:</strong> The opening tag, the closing tag, and the content together comprise the element.</li>
    </ol>
